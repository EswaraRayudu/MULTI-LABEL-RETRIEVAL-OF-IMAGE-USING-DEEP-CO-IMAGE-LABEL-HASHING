# MULTI-LABEL-RETRIEVAL-OF-IMAGE-USING-DEEP-CO-IMAGE-LABEL-HASHING
The project aims to predict multiple image labels using the DCILH algorithm, which maps images and labels into a shared Hamming space. By learning label dependencies and using a correlation-aware loss, DCILH improves multi-label image retrieval accuracy over traditional deep supervised hashing methods.
